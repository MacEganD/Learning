# Getting Started
Welcome to the Getting Started guide! In this lesson we will learn to develop a ToDo app built on a Dolittle back end, and an Aurelia front end.
The lesson consits of three parts.
- Getting up and running
- Creating the back end
- Creating the front end

## 1 - Getting started
The first thing you will need is to install the CLI tool. It is possible to use the Visual Studio Extension too, but the videos are using the CLI tool so if you are just getting started with Dolittle, we recommend following the same steps as in this lesson.

To get everything up and running, follow our Quickstart guide. This will install what you need, and verify that everything works on your computer.
Take a moment to go through the [Quickstart](www.dolittle.com) now.

## 2 - Creating the Back End
The Dolittle framework is based on a modern software architecture that leverage CQRS and Event Sourcing. These might be new concepts for you, but don't worry, by using Dolittle, we will do the heavy lifting for you while you can focus on the Business Value.
Once you have completed the ToDo app, I recommend you to check out the Architecture lesson, and the individual building blocks secionds of the documentation.

In the video below, Tomas from Dolittle will take you through all the steps needed to develop the backend for the ToDo application. In addition, he will briefly explain many of the concepts and important buildingblocks used while developing an app on Dolittle.

## 3 - Creating the Front End
In the previous step, you created the backend for the ToDO app, and had a brief look at the artifacts used to make frontend integrations with the Dolittle backend easier.

In this lesson, Pav will take you through all the steps needed to make a frontend on top of a Dolittle backend. We will use a pre-made frontend from the ToDo site (INSERT LINK).
First, the video will show you how that frontend looks, and how it works, before diving into the code changes needed to hook this into our backend.

# Architecture
Congratulations on creating your first application on Dolittle, from the backend to the frontend, with a modern and powerful architecture that makes it easy to maintain and scale your applications.
The next step I recommend you to take is to look at the Architecture lesson, and dive into the various buildingblocks the framework offers.
